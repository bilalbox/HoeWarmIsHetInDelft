# How Warm Is It In Delft?

Prints the current temperature in Delft in degrees Celcius.

# Project Setup

## Task

1. Create a Python script called 'HoeWarmIsHetInDelft.py' that retrieves from http://www.weerindelft.nl/ the current temperature in Delft and prints it to standard output, rounded to degrees Celsius.

Example expected output

```python
18 degrees Celsius
```

2. Write an appropriate dockerfile to containerize the script developed in point 1 3. Write a simple pipeline on https://www.gitlab.com that builds the container above and then executes it. We'll review the code based on clarity and correctness. It is important for the code to be robust, run correctly in a pipeline environment and to be easily troubleshooted by other DevOps engineers.

### NOTE

Please submit your solution as a link to a repository, ensuring that it is accessible to everyone.
